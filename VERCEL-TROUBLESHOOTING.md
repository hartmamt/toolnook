# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing 404 errors for static assets (like CSS and JS files) in your Vercel deployment, try these solutions:

## Solution 1: Use the Updated vercel.json

The updated `vercel.json` file in the project root should correctly configure Vercel to serve all static assets. This configuration:

1. Uses the `@vercel/static` builder for all static directories
2. Explicitly defines routes for each directory
3. Adds a `filesystem` handler to ensure static files are served first

If you're still experiencing issues with this configuration, try Solution 2.

## Solution 2: Try Static Site Mode

If Solution 1 doesn't work, you can try deploying as a pure static site:

1. Rename `vercel-static.json` to `vercel.json` (backup your current vercel.json first)
2. Redeploy your site

This configuration simplifies the deployment by treating everything as static files with specific rewrite rules.

## Solution 3: Manual File Structure Adjustments

If both solutions above don't work, you may need to reorganize your file structure:

1. Create a new folder structure that matches your URL paths:

```
public/
  index.html
  assets/...
  common/
    css/main.css
    js/main.js
  tools/
    svg-to-png/...
    color-converter/...
```

2. Deploy using a simple static site configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run vercel-build",
  "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check File Paths**: Ensure all your HTML files reference files with the correct paths
2. **Inspect Network Requests**: Use browser dev tools to see exactly which URLs are 404ing
3. **Review Build Logs**: Check Vercel's build logs for any errors or warnings
4. **Try Local Preview**: Use `vercel dev` to test your deployment locally

## Contact Vercel Support

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact Vercel support for help specific to your account and project configuration.
